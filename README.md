## Project Description
Parking has been a historical issue for UCSD, with similar complaints from students from 2006 to 2019 in response to the ever-decreasing amount of S spots on campus. Our main goal for this project was to provide information on hourly availability in each lot to make it easier for everybody on campus to find parking at UCSD. Using data from UCSDâ€™s Transportation and Parking Services, we developed a map of parking availability (excluding motorcycle parking) to identify the lots with the most open spaces for each permit type.
